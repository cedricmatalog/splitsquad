# Component Guidelines

## UI Components
- Use components from the shadcn/ui library located in [src/components/ui](mdc:src/components/ui)
- Follow Tailwind CSS for styling and use the `cn` utility for class merging

## Feature Components
- Components are organized by feature domain:
  - [src/components/groups](mdc:src/components/groups) - Group management components
  - [src/components/expenses](mdc:src/components/expenses) - Expense tracking components
  - [src/components/payments](mdc:src/components/payments) - Payment related components
  - [src/components/balances](mdc:src/components/balances) - Balance calculation components
  - [src/components/dashboard](mdc:src/components/dashboard) - Dashboard components

## Best Practices
- Use TypeScript for all component props
- For data fetching, use the appropriate service from [src/services](mdc:src/services)
- Follow the existing patterns for error handling and loading states
- Create reusable hooks in [src/hooks](mdc:src/hooks) for shared behavior
