# Database Schema

SplitSquad uses Supabase as its database with the following key tables:

## Core Tables
- `users` - User profiles and authentication
- `groups` - Expense groups (e.g., trip, household)
- `group_members` - Many-to-many relationship between users and groups
- `expenses` - Individual expenses recorded in a group
- `expense_participants` - Who owes what for each expense
- `payments` - Settlements between users in a group

## Relations
- Each group has multiple members (users)
- Expenses belong to a group and are paid by a user
- Expense participants track how much each user owes for an expense
- Payments track money transfers between users within a group

## Schema File
The complete database schema is defined in [simplified_schema.sql](mdc:simplified_schema.sql)
