This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Code Quality and Git Hooks

This project uses Husky to enforce code quality standards through Git hooks. These hooks automatically run on specific Git events to ensure code consistency and prevent issues.

See [GIT_HOOKS.md](./GIT_HOOKS.md) for detailed information about:

- The pre-commit hook (linting, formatting, and running tests for changed files)
- The commit-msg hook (conventional commit messages)
- The pre-push hook (type checking, running all tests, and building the application)
- How to run code quality checks manually

This ensures that code quality is maintained throughout the development process, and tests pass before code is committed or pushed.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
